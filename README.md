# npm Scripts Starter

The world is on fire but I'm finally getting around to learning how to set up and use npm scripts instead of Grunt or Gulp. So that's fun.

I am 99% in debt to Paul C Pederson's [Using NPM as a Task Runner](http://paulcpederson.com/articles/npm-run/) for helping me get past the "oh, wait, I get it now" hump.

This is basically a rough scaffolding for basic html/css/js projects and will probably wind up over-engineered as I figure out fun but pointless stuff I can do with this.

## Worth noting

I work in OSX land all the time, so I do non-platform-agnostic things here and there. I'll fix them if I move to another OS at some point and find out they break.
